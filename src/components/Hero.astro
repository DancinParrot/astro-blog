      I'm Kai Zhe, a student and an aspiring software engineer. My interest
      spans a wide field of domains in the tech space, including software
      development, cybersecurity and machine learning. Honestly, I've put off
      building this website for quite a loong time but at last, it's done. With
      that, I finally have my own little space amid the vast Internet to blog
      and share anything exciting that I come across!
