This article was the first blog published on my old website, kernelized.xyz which has now been taken down.

Hello, fellow wanderers of the Internet. This is my first ever blog post on my site! I'll be adding more features in the future (maybe).

You may be wondering (pretend that you are), why didn't I go for something more conventional, such as using Blogger or even Wordpress? Why did I go out of my way to buy a domain, rent a VPS just to host a blog? Well, there's not really a reason to this, it's mainly arbitrary. :) As a matter of fact, I just want a place where I can publish whatever that I want without being tied down by all the restrictions and never-ending policies imposed by those giant social media companies. So, having my own backyard on the Internet isn't that bad of an idea.

This site is literally the result of my reluctance to go through one HTML/CSS course, which undoubtedly makes the already-frustrating CSS (a.k.a Cascading Style Shit) even more challenging.

Last but not least, this site is an unfinished project which I'm pretty sure, by the looks of it, is quite obvious. With respect to the shitty state of my site, I'll be trying my best to prettify it. So, hopefully, by the time you read this blog, my website doesn't look like a huge load of dumpster fire. :)
